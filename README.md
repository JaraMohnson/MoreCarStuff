# MoreCarStuff
This is another set of code for the group repo - CarsAndUsedCars. I tried the challenges, but didn't want to mess with the group code in case this was a disaster, so I just sent it here.. 

Added two methods. 
#1 under Cars - to see if our user wants to buy or sell a car before the program moves forward. 
This returns a boolean, as I wanted the main program to look neater. I set it up in a loop to obtain a VALID CHOICE so my code doesn't blow up before 
anything actually happens. but since it returns a boolean, i think this looks a tad messy as there's true/false all over the place. The method loop is called result. 

#2. under UsedCars - takes user input and assigns it to each property of my objects/used cars, one line at a time. 
currently no error catching for errors in year, miles, and price - no idea where to start and writing 3 loops sounds awful
